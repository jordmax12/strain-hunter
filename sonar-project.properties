# Although Sonarcloud reads coverage/lcov.info which is generated by jest, Sonarcloud UI
# Coverage section includes files not listed in coverage/lcov.info. That is, jest.config.js
# "coveragePathIgnorePatterns" and Sonarcloud "sonar.coverage.exclusions" are
# un-DRY-ly orthogonal to each other. Also jest seems to automagically exclude in its coverage
# many files.
